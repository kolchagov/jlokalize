For combining different jar files in one project we use autojar.
(http://autojar.sourceforge.net/en_d/index.html)

After autojar, the META-INF is not copied, need to be done manually, deleting class path.
Also the icons from Tools.jar need to copied manually. Need to fix the autojar command line arguments.

Start autojar.bat.
