                    <h1>Logging</h1>
                    <p>
                        We use the java internal logging package <i>java.util.logging.*</i> for logging
                        into a <i>JLokalize.config/JLokalize.log</i> file which will be useful for
                        supporting the application, i.e. customers will be asked to attach log
                        file to their reports.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Internal Language Property Struct</h1>
                    <h2>For JLokalizes own language pack</h2>
                    <p>
                        The list of available languages (read from within the jar file) is represented
                        as a <i>List</i> of <i>NamedResources</i>. A <i>NamedResource</i> is a container that has a
                        name (can be sorted via this <i>String</i>), has a <i>Resource</i> and can include an
                        arbitrary <i>Object</i> (data). The <i>Resource</i> is basically a generalized link to
                        a file in the file system or inside an archiv (zip, jar).<br>
                        In our case, the <i>List</i> is populated by the <i>surveyExistingProperties</i> function
                        in the <i>PropertiesManager</i> class, a collection of static helper functions.<br>
                        At the start of the programm, name is set to the name in the default locale
                        (english at startup) via locale.getDisplayName(defaultLocale) and the data
                        object is the Locale corresponding to the language file that is specified
                        by the Resource. The whole List is sorted alphabetically by name.<br>
                        If in the Options a language is already chosen, this language is taken
                        from the list, otherwise a select Language dialog is started. Then select
                        a master language (back fall if current language does not provide a translation,
                        purely optional) which is english by design. And finally the language is
                        loaded from disk via static function loadProperties from PropertiesManager.<br>
                        This basically creates a new ExtendedProperties object, loads from a Resource,
                        and for the master does the same and sets the parent attribute in this property.
                        Then the loaded object is stored in the central static storage and retrieved
                        whereever needed. Also the default Locale is set accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <h2>For JLokalizes internal language tree handling</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the handling of the language packs it's done a little different for now. The reason
                        being mostly that we need to maintain a whole tree with clear names and everything but
                        without Locales, because we are editing the files not displaying anything. Ok, so let's see
                        how it is done.<br>
                        The tree is built via a call to loadExistingProperties from PropertiesManager with a base directory
                        as project's directory (Resource) and a base name (String). Also here, an ExtendedProperties is
                        loaded via a Resource, but then the base is set to be the projects base, then it's language tags
                        are set and the clear name as description. Finally it's inserted in a tree consisting of
                        TreeNodes of ExtendedProperties objects in the correct hierachy (according to language tags).
                        Locales are not created and not stored (since the are not needed), but could be created upon request
                        (and are so for the description).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Language/File Tree handling</h2>
                    <p>
                        As for the display of the language tree, one must implement a TreeModel (to have a working JTree) which we do by our own
                        PropertiesTreeModel. It basically capsulate TreeNodes which does most of the work. The only specific
                        addition is the getPathToRoot implementation which is needed by the Swing JTree framework and returns
                        a TreePath object. Pretty much overhead but not too difficult and works.
